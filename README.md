# Introduction to T2T
This repository provides the implementation of T2T. Please refer to our paper for more details: Captioning Smartphone Activities Using Mobile Traffic

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Pytorch ≥ 1.11.0
- Qwen-VL-Max

## Datasets:

We provide pre-extracted feature CSV files covering 20 applications across 5 application types, along with descriptions generated for each file using Qwen-VL-Max.

## Training and Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of our model using four commonly used metrics in captioning—BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr. The related tools are provided in **utils/coco-caption**.
